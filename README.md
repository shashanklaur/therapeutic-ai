# Therapeutic AI 🧠

Therapeutic AI is a lighthearted and sarcastic chatbot that simulates a digital therapist with zero credentials and unlimited sass. Built as a Useless Web project, it responds to user input with funny, quirky, and sometimes questionably helpful advice.

## 💡 Features

- 🤖 Auto-introducing therapist with simulated empathy
- 🧠 Keyword-aware responses (e.g. anxiety, tired, lonely, breakup, etc.)
- 😂 Random humorous fallback replies
- 🎨 Fully responsive UI inspired by modern chat apps
- 🛠️ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🚀 Deployed using GitHub Pages

## 📚 How It Works

- On page load, the bot introduces itself and prompts the user.
- When the user types a message, the bot checks for keywords.
- If a match is found, it returns one of several funny therapist-style responses.
- If no keyword matches, a random generic reply is used.
- Rarely, the bot might feel “overwhelmed” and tell the user to consult a priest. 😅
